# ðŸ“š Software Architecture Patterns (Ranked by Popularity)

This list ranks software architecture patterns from **most widely used** in real-world applications to **more specialized or niche** patterns.

---

## ðŸ¥‡ 1. Layered Architecture

- Also known as **n-tier architecture**
- Separates concerns into layers (e.g., Presentation â†’ Business Logic â†’ Data Access)
- Common in enterprise systems and legacy applications

---

## ðŸ¥ˆ 2. Microservices Architecture

- System is split into small, independent services
- Highly scalable and deployable
- Widely used in cloud-native applications (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)

---

## ðŸ¥‰ 3. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

- Based on producers and consumers of events
- Ideal for real-time systems (IoT, finance, gaming)
- Loosely coupled components

---

## ðŸŸ  4. RESTful Architecture (Architectural Style)

- Not a strict pattern, but a **style**
- Uses HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.) and URIs for resource access
- Common in web APIs and microservices

---

## ðŸŸ¡ 5. Client-Server Architecture

- Clients send requests, servers respond
- Fundamental model for web and mobile applications
- REST, GraphQL, and SOAP follow this model

---

## ðŸŸ¢ 6. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

- Precursors to microservices
- Services communicate via protocols (often SOAP)
- Still used in large enterprises

---

## ðŸ”µ 7. Message-Driven Architecture

- Systems interact by exchanging messages
- Great for decoupling and asynchronous communication
- Used in distributed and fault-tolerant systems

---

## ðŸ”· 8. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

- Promotes separation between core logic and external systems
- Highly testable and maintainable
- Gaining popularity in modern backend development

---

## âšª 9. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

- Separates read and write operations
- Often combined with Event Sourcing
- Used in complex and scalable systems

---

## âš« 10. Monolithic Architecture

- Entire application is deployed as a single unit
- Easier to build and deploy for small apps
- Becomes difficult to scale and maintain as the app grows

---

## ðŸŸ¥ 11. Pipe and Filter Architecture

- Data passes through a series of processing elements (filters)
- Used in compilers, media processing, data transformation

---

## ðŸŸ« 12. Broker Architecture

- Components interact through a central broker
- Useful in distributed systems (e.g., CORBA, RPC systems)

---

## ðŸŸª 13. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

- No central server; nodes communicate directly
- Common in decentralized systems (e.g., BitTorrent, Blockchain)

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 14. Blackboard Architecture

- Multiple subsystems read/write to a common data store (the blackboard)
- Used in AI systems, speech recognition, complex decision-making

---

## ðŸ“Œ Note

- Many real-world systems use **hybrid architectures**
- For example, a microservices-based system might use **layered architecture** internally
